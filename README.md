## Goals

This project is a first and important step towards the free web. It allows people to hide their web activities as much as possible by interacting with proxy servers supported by trojan servers and finally by free web movement servers.

## Name

The current name Igniter will be replace by `free web proxy` when most of the original source codes are migrated.

## Current Plans & Status

1. - [x] Separation of Trojan configuration from global settings []
2. - [ ] Enabling the ordered Trojan server list and default server selection.
3. - [ ] Enable real-time connection status
4. - [x] Minimize running modules to enable Android TV/Auto/Watch support
5. - [ ] Enable share servers with QRCODE and URI
